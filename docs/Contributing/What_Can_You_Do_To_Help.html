    <h1>Contributing to Qiqqa :: What Can You Do To Help?</h1>
<p><a href="./toc.html">toc</a></p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>We need more than just software engineers / programmers!</p>
<p>There’s plenty to do in other fields while working on improving Qiqqa:</p>
<ul>
<li>documentation for users</li>
<li>documentation for testers and developers</li>
<li>testing</li>
<li>helping out with user questions</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<h2>TBD</h2>

<p><strong>ripped raw from email: TODO: copy-edit this material</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>thanks for the offer! Not everyone has to be a programmer to help out. Rather not, I’d say!</p>
<p>First of all, any user feedback is appreciated: positive feedback helps to keep me motivated 😃</p>
<p>It’s also a great help if you test Qiqqa (experimental) releases and report any bugs/usability/weirdness observations to the github issue tracker. (You’ll need to create a github account for that, but github is not reserved for IT folk 😉 )</p>
<p>In the near future there’s going to be work done on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Qiqqa documentation (served at the new domain <a href="http://qiqqa.org">qiqqa.org</a> (<a href="https://qiqqa.og/">https://qiqqa.og/</a>) but the source material is managed at github); again there’s lots of help I could use: review, writing, copy editing, …</li>
<li>creating small Technology Tests, which are (relatively) small applications which are meant to test a specific bit of technology, before I can incorporate that into Qiqqa. Testing those executables on any hardware that will be/should be running Qiqqa is also great help as I have found that the really worrisome bugs only surface when you run your stuff “someplace else”, hence I cannot emphasize the importance of bug reports in the issue tracker at github. Any data you can provide with a bug report, including screenshots and/or (zipped) copies of log files will help me find out what’s going on both quicker and more reliably.</li>
</ol>
<p>For your information, so you get a bit of a feel for the ‘speed of development’ here:</p>
<p>“In the near future” means I plan on getting some first results on these subjects in Q2 2020 (so april/may/june); when we’re lucky there’s some quick progress but expect periods of slow going as my attention has to turn elsewhere, so, on average, progress should be reckoned in weeks or months, rather than days. You will see bursts of activity and some bouts of silence - RL can take over hard and fast sometimes.</p>
<p>I am happy with any time and effort you’re willing to spend on Qiqqa, so have a look around at the github project site. Re the documentation effort: if you’re interested in helping out there, say in a few weeks, note that you don’t even need to install <code>git</code> for that: you can fork and then use the github website to edit the text files and save your work on-line. Of course there’s more that can be done when you can work with a local copy of the project, but I just wanted to mention that the entry level is really low if you’re copywriting.</p>
<p>If you want to help out with the documentation, first order of the day would be setting up a github account for yourself (easy and free of charge), then either ‘fork’ the repository (so you have a personal copy of the source data to work with) or maybe create a small test project of your own to get used to the github website and the text editing facilities offered on-line. That would be entry level and there’s plenty you can accomplish at this “entry level”.</p>
<p>If you want to help out with testing Qiqqa and/or the technology test applications, you’ll be more dependent on me &amp; my rate of output as I’ll have to provide the binaries and installers on-line as releases for you to download them, but then all you need is a github account for providing feedback and maybe a zip application (e.g. 7-zip) when you want to upload log files of the test runs. I can send you a notification when new tests/versions are on-line via the google groups mailing list I just set up today.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think and what might interest you, then we can work something out re process.</p>

<h1>Where to get Qiqqa?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Bottom Line/TL;DR: if a <a href="https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/releases/">listed release</a> doesn‚Äôt have a setup <strong>EXEcutable</strong> of any kind in its <strong>Assets</strong> list, then it‚Äôs just a version label, not a full release. Many of those are experimental releases which  are only available at the secondary URL, listed further below.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>New Qiqqa releases are published at two different URLs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the main URL is used for tested major releases: these are published in the Releases section of repository at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/releases/">https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/releases/</a></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/402462/77826912-cd8ad800-7112-11ea-922b-cbfaed109885.png" alt="Snag_9e3530ee"></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/402462/77826888-a3d1b100-7112-11ea-80ac-125fd5b6f003.png" alt="Snag_9e340dac"></p>
<p><strong>Note: only those labels/entries which include a <code>setup.exe</code> (or a versioned version of that file, e.g. <code>setup-v82pre.exe</code>) in their Assets subsection are ‚Äúmain releases‚Äù.</strong> Currently there‚Äôs only Qiqqa v80 there; newer releases are still <em>experimental</em> and only available at the secondary URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All <em>experimental</em> releases are published at the secondary URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases">https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases</a></p>
<p>The same rule applies here: only actual <em>releases</em> have a setup exe ready for download in their Assets subsection:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/402462/77827037-b5678880-7113-11ea-82b3-d37550161bc4.png" alt="Snag_9e3b2316"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Installing a Qiqqa release</h1>
<p>When you  doubleclick the installer after downloading, it will run and <em>overwrite</em> the existing Qiqqa version (after a dialog has reported a different version is being installed).</p>
<p>This is harmless, as your libraries reside elsewhere on your disk and those <strong>are not touched</strong> during the install, only the Qiqqa executable and underlying binaries are replaced by an install action.</p>
<p>Qiqqa v80 and v82 releases are backwards compatible with Qiqqa v79 (commercial), which means:</p>
<p>When you want to ‚Äòrevert‚Äô to the older version you had before, you download its installer (for v79 that‚Äôs either at <a href="http://qiqqa.com">qiqqa.com</a> or the copy in the secondary repository‚Äôs releases list: <a href="https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases/tag/v79">https://github.com/GerHobbelt/qiqqa-open-source/releases/tag/v79</a></p>
<p>That install process will be exactly the same and will overwrite the installed Qiqqa version once again, thus reverting to your old version.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: every Qiqqa installer replaces what you have. It does not care whether it overwrites with newer or older software. That way you can always revert to a ‚Äúknown to work‚Äù version.</p>

<h1>FAQ (TBD)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>What steps should some take to update to a new version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the description above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I install a new version will it automatically delete the old version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. All your data is kept intact. Only the Qiqqa binaries are replaced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I download and unzip the latest release it appears that not all packages have a setup.exe file to update to. Does this mean that one should just browse the folders and look for the folder that has the most current setup.exe file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, the ZIP files are <strong>source code only</strong> archives. For a while, the generated setup binaries were included in the source code repo but that was <em>wrong</em> use of git &amp; GitHub.</p>
<p>Actual releases are available as setup*.exe installers at the afore-mentioned URLs in the <strong>Assets</strong> subsection(s).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It appears that there was a transition in the naming convention of the setup.exe in open source. The file no longer contains the version number. If this correct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, v80 was published without a version encoded in the setup.exe; this has happened with a few experimental releases as well. Newer experimental releases follow a version scheme similar to MAJOR.minor.buildnumber, e.g. v82.0.7357.40407 (which is sometimes also referred to as v82pre9,  i.e. the 9th experimental prerelease of Qiqqa v82). The buildnumber <code>7357.40407</code> is an encoded timestamp: higher is more recent, thus newer release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Makes it harder to search for the most current version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, I concur. That is a bit messy, while we got our act together. üòÑ</p>

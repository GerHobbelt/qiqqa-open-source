(TBD: move BLAKE3 performance stuff and fingerprint size calculus here? Currently that info is at [Fingerprinting - moving forward and away from b0rked SHA1 > Quick update](Progress%20in%20Development/Considering%20the%20Way%20Forward/Fingerprinting%20Documents/Fingerprinting%20-%20moving%20forward%20and%20away%20from%20b0rked%20SHA1.md#quick-update) onwards.)

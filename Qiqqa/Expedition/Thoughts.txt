The user must run their tags and autotags.
If there are more than 100 tags then we can use them as the associative net.
Otherwise we will have to fall back on the actual words in the documents.
Or perhaps we make this an option (auto, tags, words)

We then run the topic generator - how many topics are we going to use?
Perhaps some function of the number of documents - sqrt or log of that number is intuitive.
I would think for 100 docs we need 20 topics, for 1000 docs we need 50 topics, for 5000 docs 100 topics, 20000 docs, 200 topics...
Perhaps log is too extreme - log 5k and log20k are hardly different...
it would also be nice from a gui perspective to have a square number of topics, so that they can be presented in a square on the screen...?
Or perhaps the radial version is better - that was quite intuitive in the corpus topic exploratory tool.

   docs	 target	        sqrt	         ln		sqrt sq
     50 	 	  7.07106781	3.912023005		      9
    100 	 20	 10.00000000	4.605170186		     16
  1,000 	 50	 31.62277660	6.907755279		     36
  5,000 	100	 70.71067812	8.517193191		     81
 10,000 		100.00000000	9.210340372		    100
 20,000 	200	141.42135620	9.903487553		    144

Then we want to present these topics.
In the overarching topic screen we can list the top-5 tags and top-5 docs and most similar topics for each topic.
If they click a topic, it expands to show the top-N tags and docs and other topics.
<ESC> unexpands that topic again.
If they click a DOC in a topic, then on the RHS it can show the doc, its topics, and a citation graph of who cites it and who it is cited by.

    <h1>Working with PDFs as a developer :: Odd, odder, oddest, …ehm… <em>PDF!</em></h1>
<p>Just a collection of notes of what I’ve run into while working on Qiqqa and related tools to process PDFs.</p>
<p>Most<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> of this stuff is reproducible using the PDFs in the Evil Collection of PDFs.</p>
<p>Alas, you can’t have them all, they say…</p>
<h2>Repair &amp; Linearize for Web?… You Better <em>NOT</em>!</h2>
<p><code>qpdf -qdr</code> does a fine job, but sometimes that job is just <strong>way too fine</strong>: as I was considering iff <code>qpdf</code> and/or <code>mutool repair</code> and/or other tools could be used to produce PDFs (from source PDFs) which would be more palatable and easier to process by Qiqqa et al, I discovered that, on a few occassions, <code>qpdf -qdr</code> was able to produce PDFs of over 1 GIGAbyte(!) from humble beginnings such as a ~10MByte source PDF. Thus ‘linearize for web’ and similar ‘restructuring cleanup’ actions SHOULD NOT be performed to help displaying / processing these buggers in Qiqqa et al.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this, of course, does not mean that <code>qpdf</code> is an unuseful tool: on the contrary! <code>qpdf decrypt</code> and a few other tools (<code>mutool repair</code>) help greatly in getting some obnoxious PDFs displayed on screen, just like Acrobat would show them (see also <a href="https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/issues/9">https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/issues/9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/issues/136">https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/issues/136</a>).</p>
<h2>There’s 3 ways Qiqqa’s is attempting to calculate a PDF’s total page count: Jimme must have gotten some real bad trouble too!</h2>
<p>Check the source code.</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em> we can improve this by getting back to one or maybe two different ways there when we introduce the new MuPDF-based rendering engine (to replace the Sorax one). But until that time: note that the Sorax version (which is the first attempt at getting a page count) rarely delivers; the Jimme hack (attempt number 3 in there) is often reached as the other two modes don’t deliver a viable page count. <em>Oops?!</em></p>

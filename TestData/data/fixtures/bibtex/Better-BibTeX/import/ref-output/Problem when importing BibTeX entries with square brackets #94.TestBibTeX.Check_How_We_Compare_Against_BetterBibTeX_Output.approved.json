        "abstract": "Cluster model calculations have been carried out to study the electronic state and the chemical bonding in\r\nCu2O and CuO as well as YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6. The clusters used are Cu4O14-9, Cu4O16-12, Cu3O17-12 and Cu3O15-10,\r\nrespectively, each being embedded in an appropriate electrostatic potential reflecting the crystal structure. The\r\ncovalent interaction between Cu and O is most significant in the cluster for the high-temperature superconductor\r\nYBa2CuO7. It is remarkable that O 2p[pi] holes are created near the Fermi level and stabilized in the O----Cu+---O-\r\nlinear bond formed in the basal Cu2O plane of the cluster for YBa2Cu3O7. A charge disproportionation takes place both in\r\nthe model clusters for YBa2Cu3O7 and YBa2Cu3O6, while a spin polarization is seen only in the latter. The similarity and\r\ndissimilarity of Cu atoms in those oxides are discussed.",

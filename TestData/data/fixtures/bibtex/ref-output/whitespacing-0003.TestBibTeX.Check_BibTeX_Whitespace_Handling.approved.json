    "% title, abstract, etc. should be trimmed, i.e. leading and trailing whitespace should be removed.\r\n% Meanwhile, the internal structure of the 'abstract' field should be kept intact.\r\n%\r\n% Keywords should be split up properly with the whitespace and commas+semicolons not haphazardly spread around inside that set."

Note that this page contains old information collected from the *defunct* getsatisfaction Qiqqa Forum. It is provided here as a historical record, while it *may* still provide some useful insights.

*However*, be very aware of the fact that this page (and all others marked with this same warning) may very well contain information that is very much *outdated* and **does not apply to modern Qiqqa Open Source releases**. 

In short: **YMMV** (Your Mileage May Vary)

You have been warned...

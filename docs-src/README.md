# Documentation (Source Directory)

This one contains the collection of documentation for Qiqqa and related tools and materials.

It includes:

- The Qiqqa User Manuals
- Both [**the old one from back in the Commercial Qiqqa days**](<./The Official Manual (v79 Old Commercial)/>)
- And [**the new Open Source Qiqqa Manual** (under development)](<./The Official Manual (v80-89 Open Source)/>)
- [The (**old**) getsatisfaction forum 'mirror' (or rather: partial recovery)](./getsatisfaction-mirror/), which contains additional information and user discussions from older days. Still some very useful stuff in there, so we keep it around.^[The getsatisfaction forum site is another example of sites disappearing after parent company buyout, alas. No backups or official recovery were provided.]
- [The Qiqqa FAQ and other Qiqqa user & developer articles & notes](./Notes/), currently managed through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- Site design work, scripting and miscellaneaous...
